# How I reverse engineered a commercial spatial audio effect (C#)

> A clean, dependency-free **C#** reference implementation of **How I reverse engineered a commercial spatial audio effect**, focused on core algorithmic mechanics, clear memory layout, and test verification.

## Overview & Mechanics

The implementation focuses on the core mathematical properties of **How I reverse engineered a commercial spatial audio effect**:
* **Data Organization**: Built upon `Node Pointers & Self-Balancing Trees` to ensure predictable traversal and storage overhead.
* **Safety Invariants**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Execution Guarantees**: Execution behavior is validated against nominal workflows and boundary edge cases.

## Complexity Profile

* **Time Complexity**:
  * Fast Path (Best): `O(1)`
  * Generalized (Avg / Worst): `O(log N)`
* **Space Footprint**: `O(N)` resident heap / stack overhead.

## Verification & Test Scenarios

The test suite in `main.cs` validates:
* Standard operational paths against expected outcomes.
* Extreme values and edge inputs to ensure robust failure handling.
* State stability across sequential and repeated operations.

```bash
# Execute local verification runner
csharp main.cs
```
