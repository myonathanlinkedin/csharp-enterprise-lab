# LMAX Disruptor Ring Buffer Pattern

Self-contained **LMAX Disruptor Ring Buffer Pattern** algorithmic primitive written in idiomatic **C#**. Built from scratch using standard library constructs with zero external dependencies.

### Core Highlights
* **Language & Standard**: Modern `C#` standard library conventions.
* **Architecture Pattern**: Designed for `Low-Latency Systems & Memory Layout` using `Contiguous Memory Buffer & Ring Pointers`.
* **Runtime Overhead**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Concurrency & Safety**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

### Complexity Analysis

| Dimension | Bound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Best Case)** | `O(1)` |
| **Time (Worst Case)** | `O(1) amortized` |
| **Auxiliary Space** | `O(N) bounded` |

### Test Suite Execution

Self-contained verification drivers are embedded directly in `main.cs` to validate happy paths, boundary inputs, and invariant preservation.

```bash
csharp main.cs
```
